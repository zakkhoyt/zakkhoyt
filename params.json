{"name":"Zakkhoyt","tagline":"","body":"### About me\r\n\r\nI've been working in engineering since 1999. I began my career building hardware and firmware which would perform electrical testing on other circuits (IRVC). Along-side, I wrote computer software which told the tester what to test as well as control a robotic XYZ/W pick and place machine to create shorts or probe. \r\n\r\nIn 2005 I transitioned into a C++ development role where I mainly wrote middle-ware for digital jukeboxes and ported a popular VOIP library to OSX and iOS (which became Gogole's WebRTC project).\r\n\r\nIn 2011 I had become comfortable writing iOS software both professionally and personally. I love the mix of low level sensors mixed with powerful computing and graphics processing. iPhones were the hot new thing and looked to be the future, so I decided to make the jump from C++ to dedicated iOS development. \r\n\r\nIn 2012 I started working for a startup which would rapidly prototype ideas and try to spin them off as new companies. My spectrum of iOS abilities exploded in this position. From start to end, low level to high level, testing and selecting third party libraries, crisp/snappy UI, modeling/caching sizable data structures, OAuth, REST, and plenty more. \r\n\r\nAs a hobbyist, I've published a handful of iOS Apps on the App Store with several more in the later stages of development. I've also written a few useful frameworks which made good candidates for Cocoapods. \r\n\r\nLately I've been coming up to speed with Swift which (as a C/C++ programmer) is a bit different at first. I've really grown to like the concise syntax powerful range checking, optionals, and the new Array utilities. \r\n\r\nI'm currently looking for my next iOS gig. You can find a current copy of my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9n_bDZpsL1CNndUc3NUUGpnLU0). \r\n\r\n#### iOS Cococapods\r\n\r\n[VWWPermissionKit](https://github.com/zakkhoyt/VWWPermissionKit) - A visual permission prompt manager for iOS.\r\n\r\n[VWWClusteredMapView](https://github.com/zakkhoyt/VWWClusteredMapView) - A MKMapView with annotation clustering.\r\n\r\n#### Released iOS Apps\r\n\r\n[Theremin](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/theremin-motion-sensors-touch/id570320684?mt=8)\r\n\r\n[RC Balancer](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rc-balancer/id915904234?mt=8)\r\n\r\n#### Development iOS Apps\r\n\r\n[StopDrinking](https://github.com/zakkhoyt/StopDrinking) - Helps people track their progress and stay on track.\r\n\r\n[ZHTimeLapse](https://github.com/zakkhoyt/ZHTimeLapse) - Create time lapse videos with varying frame rate, resolution, and filters.
