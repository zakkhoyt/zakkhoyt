<p>I received an AAS in Electronics Technology from Boise State University in 1999. I immediately began working in the  engineering field. I began by building hardware/firmware which could perform electrical testing on other circuits (IRVC). Along-side, I wrote software which told the tester what/where to test and also told a robotic XYZ/W pick and place machine where to create shorts or probe. </p>

<p>In 2005 I transitioned into a C++ development role where I mainly wrote middle-ware (new features &amp; debugging) for digital jukeboxes. Also ported a popular C++ VOIP library to OSX and iOS (which became Gogole's WebRTC project).</p>

<p>In 2011 I had become comfortable writing iOS software both professionally and personally. I love the mix of low level sensors mixed with powerful computing and graphics processing. iPhones were the hot new thing and looked to be the future, so I decided to make the jump from C++ to dedicated iOS development. </p>

<p>In 2012 I began working for a startup which would rapidly prototype ideas and then spin them off as new companies. My spectrum of iOS abilities exploded from this experience. From start to end, low level to high level, testing and selecting third party libraries, crisp/snappy UI, modeling/caching sizable data structures, OAuth, REST, beta releases, App Store releases, and plenty more.</p>

<p>On the side (as a hobbyist), I've published a handful of iOS Apps on the App Store with several more in the later stages of development. I've also written a few useful frameworks which made for good Cocoapods. </p>

<p>Lately I've been coming up to speed with Swift. I've really grown to like the concise syntax, powerful range checking, optionals, and the new Array utilities &amp; Swift utilities such as lazy and defer. </p>

<p>It's just about 2016 and I'm looking for my next full time iOS gig in San Francisco. You can find a current copy of my resume <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9n_bDZpsL1CNndUc3NUUGpnLU0">here</a>. </p>
